For Storm Water, easements are property interests which document the conditions under which Storm Water has permission to enter an easement area on private property to repair drainage issues and/or perform on-going maintenance. A storm drainage easement is a recorded, legal document which describes easement boundaries and any conditions and restrictions related to the permission granted by the property owner to Storm Water. Under the easement, the property owner is the grantor and the City (or other applicable municipality through Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water) is the grantee. This represents a location where there is a Storm Water Services Easement. This may not be inclusive of all easements. Please consult Land Records to perform research.",
